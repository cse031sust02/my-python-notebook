    "## PEPs\n",
    "\n",
    "PEPs are Python Enhancement Proposals. They describe changes to Python itself, or the standards around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PEP8\n",
    "The most important PEP is PEP 8 which is the style guide for python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "`A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is the most important.`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some important rules of PEP 8\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use 4 spaces per indentation level\n",
    "\n",
    "- maximum line length is 79 characters\n",
    "\n",
    "- Line break after a binary operator\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   # easy to match operators with operands\n",
    "   total = (price_per_item * quantity +\n",
    "            tax_amount -\n",
    "            discount)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imports\n",
    "    - Imports should usually be on separate lines\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Imports should be grouped in the following order\n",
    "        - Standard library imports.\n",
    "        - Related third party imports.\n",
    "        - Local application/library specific imports\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We should put a blank line between each group of imports. [..tips](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_sort-imports)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        import os\n",
    "                    \n",

    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Comment : Comments should be complete sentences.\n",
    "    - If a comment is a phrase or sentence, the first word should be capitalized (unless it is an identifier that starts with a lowercase letter).\n",
    "    - If a comment is short, the period at the end can be omitted\n",
    "    - Block comments usually describe the code that comes after them and should be indented at the same level. Each line of a block comment starts with a # and a single space (unless it is indented text inside the comment).  Paragraphs inside a block comment are separated by a line containing a single #.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    # Verify the metaclass\n",
    "      mcs = next(caller.args[0].infer(context=context))\n",
    "      if mcs.__class__.__name__ != 'ClassDef':\n",

    "          return None\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Documentation Strings (aka docstrings) : Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods. Docstrings are not necessary for non-public methods, but we should have a comment that describes what the method does. This comment should appear after the def line.\n",
    "  - PEP 257 describes good docstring conventions. Note that most importantly, the \"\"\" that ends a multiline docstring should be on a line by itself, e.g.,\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  def calculate_area(length, width):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Calculates the area of a rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        length (float): The length of the rectangle.\n",
    "        width (float): The width of the rectangle.\n",

    "    Returns:\n",

    "    return area\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "        \n",
    "- Naming Convention :\n",
    "    - Modules should have short and all-lowercase names (Underscores can be used)\n",
    "    - Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.\n",
    "    - Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.\n",
    "    - Constants are written in all capital letters with underscores separating words. Examples : MAX_OVERFLOW and TOTAL."
